Ruby scripts to grab the contents of one database and copying them into a different datbase allowing for different tables and column names in the target.

Simple script to parse a YAML file to determine the translation required
in the names and columns from a source to destination database.

It would be great if was possible to provide the column names and their
respective values as arrays for including in the prepared statements;
the code would be a lot cleaner, but instead we have to pick apart the
columns and values to create an insert statement for every value.

The expected YAML format is as follows:

database:
  - [source_database, src_db_user, src_db_passwd]
  - [destination_database, dest_db_user, dest_db_passwd]
table1:
  - column1
  - column2
  - [source_column, destination_column]
destination_table:
source_table:
  - column1
  - column2

The script will most likely error if the data is not in that format.
There are no nods or winks to security, bounds checking or any other
usage consideration. It's quick and dirty and does the job.
